    <h1>Grilled Salmon with Lemon and Herbs</h1>
    <h2>Recipe by: Marlynn Scholand</h2>
    <p>
      I chose Grilled Salmon with Lemon and Herbs because it is one of my
      favorite foods and one of the simplest to prepare. Salmon also contains
      various essential vitamins and minerals. The recipe was from a website
      named urbanblisslife.

    <h3>Steps on how to make Grilled Salmon with Lemon and Herbs:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1: Prepare all the ingredients: Salmon, Lemon, Dill, Salt + Pepper,
        Melted Butter, and Garlic. (You can use any salmon for this recipe. Heat
        your outdoor grill to medium heat. Season both sides of the salmon with
        salt and pepper. Place salmon onto a large sheet of aluminum foil that
        is large enough to wrap around the salmon. Bring the sides of the foil
        up to create a barrier so that the next few ingredients won't spill out.

        Step 5: Fold up foil edges and corners gently around the salmon. You
        don't want to pack it in tightly - just lightly so that the entire
        salmon is covered but has a little bit of breathing room between the
        meat and the foil. Grill at medium heat for about 15-18 minutes.
